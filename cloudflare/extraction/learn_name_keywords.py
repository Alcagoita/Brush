KAN-397. Learns name->type keywords from the corpus instead of writing them
by hand.

KAN-391 recovered 10,296 type assignments from venue names, and every term
in it was hand-written after reading Portuguese data. That does not survive
the second country. Nobody here is going to hand-write the Japanese list.

But the mapping is a statistic, not an act of authorship: most records ARE
correctly tagged, and those records are the training signal for the ones
that are not. `pastelaria` appears in bakery-tagged rows far above the base
rate, which is exactly what earns it a place in the map. The same
computation over Japanese data surfaces Japanese terms, with nobody reading
the language.

## Method

  1. take rows that already carry a type from tags or categories
  2. tokenize normalized names into unigrams and bigrams, so multi-word
     terms like `snack bar` survive
  3. for each (token, type): support, P(type | token), and lift against the
     type's base rate
  4. keep what clears both thresholds
  5. rank and emit for review

## Guard rails, each earning its place

  * MIN_SUPPORT, or one oddly named venue becomes a rule.
  * MIN_LIFT, so a term must PREDICT a type rather than merely co-occur
    with a common one. `lisboa` appears beside every type in the country.
  * Brands are excluded. `Pingo Doce` predicts supermarket perfectly and is
    a brand, not a category — the brand dictionary already knows it, and
    learning it here would duplicate that with worse precision.
  * Stopwords: company-registration markers (`unipessoal`, `lda`, `sa`) and
    the geography that shows up in every Portuguese business name.

## What it does NOT do

It never writes to the classifier. The output is a ranked candidate list a
person accepts or rejects term by term, because the product call is not in
the data: the statistics would cheerfully map `snack bar` to `bar`, since
Portuguese snack-bars do carry bar-ish tags — and KAN-391 deliberately maps
it to `cafe`, because a snack-bar is a daytime eatery and answering "grab a
beer tonight" with one is wrong. `cervejaria` was excluded for the same
kind of reason.
