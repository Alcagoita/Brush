"""
KAN-404 phase 3b. Adds the MISSING types to the rows promoted from
`poi_candidate`.

The promotion wrote one `poi_type` row per place. `classify_and_load` writes
every type a place qualifies for, because a place genuinely can be more than
one thing — a Portuguese pastelaria is a bakery AND a café, and most of them
are.

Carrying two types is not the problem. Carrying ONE when it should carry two
is: the place then answers a search for the type it has and is invisible to
the other. A promoted pastelaria typed `store` cannot answer "buy bread".

4,268 promoted rows carry more than one Foursquare category and got a single
type from it; ~1,000 more have a name stating a type their category never
mentioned.

This is fixable in place, without re-importing, because every promoted row
stored `raw_category_ids` and `raw_category_labels` verbatim. That is what
keeping them was for.

Three sources of types, all of which the promotion should have used:

  * exact category id match — what classify_and_load's build_reverse_map does
  * label-path descent — what the promotion did, and what catches a category
    Foursquare filed one level below one we map (KAN-403's 58,494 rows)
  * the name — KAN-391's keywords, for places whose category says nothing

Purely additive. `poi_type` is INSERT OR IGNORE on (fsq_place_id, poi_type),
new types are written at rank 1 and above, and `primary_poi_type` is left
exactly as it is: this fixes what a search can MATCH, not what the card
displays, and changing the display type is a separate decision.
