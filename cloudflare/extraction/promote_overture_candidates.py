KAN-431 phase 3. Promotes `overture_candidate` rows into `overture_poi`.

TWO WAYS IN, IN THIS ORDER

  1. The category, through src/overtureCategories.json.
  2. The NAME, through classify_and_load's types_from_name — the KAN-391
     machinery. A "Talho Halal Barakah" filed under `halal_restaurant` and a
     "Papelaria Açores" filed under `arts_and_crafts` both state what they
     are in their own name, and the category is simply wrong.

The name may only ADD a type the category could not supply. It never
overrides a category that mapped, because the category is the source's
considered answer and the name is an inference from a string.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT DONE

No suffix rule on the category. `*_restaurant -> restaurant` looks free and
gains 4 points on Odivelas, but the same rule sends `auto_body_shop` and
`auto_parts_and_supply_store` to `store` — reintroducing exactly what
KAN-412 excluded — and `driving_school`/`dance_school` to `school`, which is
not the errand that word means in this app. A rule that is right about the
tail and wrong about the exclusions is not worth 4 points.

Everything unmatched stays `pending`. It is countable there, which is the
point of staging: the next mapping decision comes from what actually
arrived, not from reading a taxonomy.

# KAN-431. Overture's hair-and-beauty categories are a shrug, and measuring
# Odivelas says so: of 401 rows filed `spas`, 86 are named "Cabeleireiro" and

# barbers; and 5 of the 97 filed `barber` are actually cabeleireiros.

# and OSM — and the category cannot tell them apart. Where a name says which
# one it is, the name wins outright rather than joining as a second type,
# because ranking a barbearia's `salon` first would show the wrong thing and
