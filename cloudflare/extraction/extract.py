"""
KAN-354. Generates and runs the Foursquare Iceberg query DuckDB previously
ran from hand-written per-city files (extract_lisboa.sql, extract_odivelas.sql)
— same query shape, built dynamically from category_ids.py's full category
list instead of a copy-pasted 90-id literal, and parameterized by either a
bbox (place mode) or a country code (country mode) instead of a hardcoded
one.

Country field assumption: Foursquare OS Places' published schema
(opensource.foursquare.com/os-places) documents a `country` column
(ISO 3166-1 alpha-2) and a `locality` column on `places_os` — this is what
lets country mode filter by country exactly (docs/poi-coverage-model.md's
`country_schema.sql` note: "No bbox if the Foursquare dataset carries a
country field") and discover distinct settlements via `locality` grouping
without a separate admin-boundary source. Not re-verified against a live
query from this environment (no network/JWT access while writing this) —
confirm both columns exist with a quick `DESCRIBE places.datasets.places_os`
before the first real country-mode run; if `locality` doesn't carry a
useful per-settlement value, country mode needs a different partitioning
key (e.g. `region` + a coarser geohash grouping instead).
