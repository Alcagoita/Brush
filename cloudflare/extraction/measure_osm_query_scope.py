"""
KAN-405. Measures what the OSM supplement never asks Overpass for.

Sibling to KAN-403's Foursquare measurement, same discipline: read-only
counts, no import, no change to the live query. Measure first.

`supplement_osm_pois.osm_query` asks for four selectors — a 15-value
`amenity` enum, `office=financial`, a 2-value `leisure` enum, and a blanket
`shop`. Everything else in OSM is simply not fetched, and no query against
our own data can reveal it, because `osm_poi` stores no raw tags either.

Three failure modes, and this script separates them:

  NEVER REQUESTED   outside the selectors entirely. `tourism=*` in full, so
                    museums, hotels and attractions never arrive.
                    `highway=bus_stop` likewise — and `bus` reaches 778 POIs
                    nationally, the thinnest type we ship.
  DEGRADED          `shop=*` is blanket-queried, so `shop=butcher` and
                    `shop=optician` DO arrive and land as generic `store`
                    because TAG_TYPES has no rule for them. Already in the
                    database, unfindable by errand.
  FETCHES NOTHING   `amenity=ice_cream` is in TAG_TYPES but absent from the
                    selector, so it is never fetched at all (KAN-399).

## Why counts and not a full ranking

Overpass has no GROUP BY. A true ranking of every unrequested value would
mean downloading the tags of every element in Portugal, which is exactly
the kind of request the usage policy exists to stop. Instead this counts a
curated list of values with `out count`, batched many-per-request, and states
plainly that it is a targeted measurement rather than an exhaustive one.

## Rate limit

Overpass enforces by blocking, and KAN-387 lost a day to it.

One request per value was rate-limited after TWO queries even at 3s spacing:
each `out count` scans the whole country, and the limit is on cost and slots
rather than request rate, so spacing them further apart does not help. The
counts are therefore batched many-per-request — 85 requests become six.

On a 429 the run reads Overpass's own status endpoint, waits the interval it
announces and retries, giving up only after MAX_SLOT_WAITS with partial
results kept.
Waiting for the time the service publishes is the mechanism it provides;
switching mirrors to dodge the limit would not be.
