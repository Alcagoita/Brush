KAN-431 phase 1. Pulls Overture Maps places for a bounding box into a CSV.

WHY THIS IS NOT SHAPED LIKE extract.py OR THE OSM SUPPLEMENT

Overture publishes as public Parquet on S3. There is no API, no key, no
rate limit and no per-request cost, so a whole-country pull is one DuckDB
scan with bbox predicate pushdown. None of KAN-387's batching, leasing or
backoff machinery applies — that exists because Overpass is a shared
service that enforces its policy by blocking, and this is a file read.

WHAT IT EXCLUDES, AND WHY IT IS AN EXCLUDE LIST

KAN-404's rule: import everything, decide afterwards. It binds harder here
than it did for Foursquare — Portugal alone has 1,357 distinct Overture
categories, which is far too many to whitelist confidently, and a category
nobody anticipated would be invisible forever because our own data cannot
show what was never requested.

So this excludes only what is certainly not a place a person runs an errand
at, and everything else is staged for classification. The list below is a
starting position measured from PT data, not a taxonomy — widen or narrow
it from what actually arrives, and record why.

Note `travel_service` is deliberately absent from the exclusions: there were
10 rows within 100 m of one point in Baixa, and a travel agency may well be
a real errand. That is a decision to make from data, not in advance.

BBOX IS FOR PILOTS. COUNTRY IS FOR IMPORTS.

extract_country is the shape a real import takes, and it matches
extract.extract_country: one pull filtered on `country`, no per-municipality
iteration. --bbox exists so a pilot can measure one town against a known
truth list; it is not how Portugal gets loaded.

Usage:
  python3 extract_overture.py --bbox MIN_LAT,MAX_LAT,MIN_LNG,MAX_LNG --out <csv>
  python3 extract_overture.py --place <place_id> --out <csv>
  python3 extract_overture.py --country PT --out <csv>
