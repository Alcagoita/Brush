"""
KAN-354. Entrypoint for the extraction Container — reads MODE/TARGET from
the environment (set per-invocation via `envVars` when the Worker calls
`container.start(...)`, see cloudflare/src/index.ts's triggerBuild) and
runs the one pipeline both triggers share, per docs/poi-coverage-model.md:

  MODE=place   TARGET=<place_id>       — on-demand, whole Place, all types
  MODE=country TARGET=<country_code>   — pre-build, every settlement in the
                                          country, one Place at a time

Same extraction/classification code either way (extract.py, classify_and_load.py)
— only how the target scope is discovered differs.

D1 and R2 access go through the Worker's own bindings (d1_client.py /
r2_client.py, via extractionContainer.ts's outboundByHost) — no Cloudflare
API token or R2 keys needed here. Required environment:
  FOURSQUARE_JWT       — Iceberg catalog auth (expires; see cloudflare/README.md)
  BUILD_TRIGGER_SECRET — the same secret the Worker's /internal/* routes check
  POI_API_BASE_URL (optional, defaults to the production Worker)

    Before this, "mapped" meant two different things. A country-mapped Place
    got Foursquare AND the OSM supplement — 75,491 OSM-only venues across PT,
    the small cafes and talhos the open Foursquare dataset never had. An
    on-demand Place got Foursquare alone, and reported the same `mapped`. A
    user asking for Tokyo was quietly given a thinner database than a user in
    Lisboa.

    One Place is one bbox, which is exactly the unit `supplement_scope`
    already claims and checkpoints for the country run — so this reuses it
    rather than inventing a second path. The country's claim/lease machinery
    is not reused: it exists to spread 307 municipality scopes across
    container lifetimes, and a single scope has nothing to spread.

    The bbox comes from the caller, not from `import_place`'s D1 lookup: at
    this point in the flow the Place row has no extent yet, because the
    build-complete callback is what records it.

    **A failure here does not fail the Place.** The Foursquare rows are
    already loaded and useful, so the choice is between a Place mapped with
    one source and a Place with nothing. Overpass being rate limited is not
    the Place's fault, and stranding it in `mapping` is the one outcome
    KAN-387 was written to prevent. The shortfall is logged and the Place
