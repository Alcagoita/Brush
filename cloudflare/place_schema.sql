-- KAN-355. Renamed from `city` (KAN-329/346) — "Place" is the app's own
-- word for any settlement (city, town, village; "Places I know", "Teach it
-- a new place"), and it's what this table has always modeled. Full
-- reasoning: docs/poi-coverage-model.md.
--
-- One row per settlement, in the shared brush-poi-registry database
-- alongside `poi` (schema.sql), `country` (country_schema.sql) and
-- `build_log` (build_log_schema.sql).
--
-- Its one job: telling a true zero from an unmapped one. Only queried on a
-- zero result (docs/poi-coverage-model.md's zero check) — that's what keeps
-- it cheap, and why no pre-computed coverage geometry is needed beyond the
-- extent actually ingested. KAN-378 also stores real bounded OSM settlement
-- metadata here after a country POI import; no radius is ever invented.
