--
-- Foursquare's open dataset is stale, and the OSM import is the thing that
-- proves WHICH records are stale — then throws most of that evidence away.
-- `Café Destaque` standing where Foursquare still says `A Brazileira de
-- Torres` is a venue that changed hands and the dataset never noticed. That
-- is the input to a later name-refresh pass, so it has to be queryable.
--
-- Two classes come out of classify_scope / confident_match:
--
--   disagreement  the OSM element was ADMITTED despite a same-type source row
--                 within 75 m under a materially different name. Both rows
--                 now exist. Written to an R2 JSON report today.
--
--   ambiguous     the OSM element matched two or more candidates
--                 indistinguishably, so it was dropped entirely. Recorded
--                 today as a counter and nothing else — 187 elements across
--                 the first 189 PT municipalities, gone. This is the class
--                 this table exists for.
--
-- The R2 report keeps being written. It is still the fastest way to eyeball
-- one municipality without a query; this is for everything a JSON blob per
-- scope cannot do — joining, counting, triaging across a country.
