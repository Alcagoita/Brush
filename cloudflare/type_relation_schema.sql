-- Merge rules as data (KAN-337, Phase 5). Replaces the hardcoded
-- TYPE_MERGE_INCLUDES object in src/index.ts — a search for search_type
-- also returns places matching every include_type row, letting merge
-- rules be tuned without a code deploy. Loaded once per Worker isolate
-- and cached in module scope (see loadTypeRelations in src/index.ts) —
-- not re-queried on every request.
--
-- Directional, not symmetric groups. Foursquare's taxonomy splits some
-- real-world-equivalent venues into sibling leaf categories (supermarket
-- vs. grocery_store — same kind of place to a shopper, just inconsistently
-- labeled) and genuinely contains one type inside another (every bank
-- branch has an ATM; a standalone ATM is not a bank):
--   - searching a broad/containing type also returns the narrower type it
--     structurally contains (atm -> atm+bank)
--   - searching the narrower type does NOT pull in the broader one (bank
--     search must not return standalone ATMs with no other bank services)
--   - genuine synonyms merge both ways (supermarket <-> grocery_store)
--   - a distinct real intent never merges with a nearby type even if
--     Foursquare's tree puts them close together (convenience_store stays
--     isolated — deliberately different "quick top-up" intent from "the
--     weekly grocery run")
--
-- self-rows (e.g. atm -> atm) are required: a search_type with no row at
-- all falls back to searching itself only (see loadTypeRelations), but a
-- search_type that HAS rows must explicitly include itself too, or it
-- would stop matching its own type the moment it gained a merge partner.
