# KAN-404 phase 2 — what is in poi_candidate

Candidates scanned: **217,106**

Identity index built from 222,782 `poi` rows and 75,490 `osm_poi` rows, matched on normalized name within 75m at similarity >= 0.72.

| outcome | rows | share |
|---|---:|---:|
| Already in the database under another name | 17,325 | 8.0% |
| Fits a type the app already ships | 48,720 | 22.4% |
| Classifiable, but onto a type the app has no PoiType for | 3,514 | 1.6% |
| Needs a product decision | 147,547 | 68.0% |

Of the duplicates, 11,272 match an OSM row and 6,053 match a Foursquare row already in `poi`.

## Absorbed by an existing type

No new app work: no catalog entry, no icon, no translations.

| existing type | rows |
|---|---:|
| `store` | 29,535 |
| `restaurant` | 11,687 |
| `bar` | 3,419 |
| `gym` | 1,451 |
| `school` | 616 |
| `bakery` | 529 |
| `tattoo` | 386 |
| `park` | 309 |
| `cafe` | 287 |
| `hairdresser` | 180 |

| `currency_exchange` | 10 |
| `nail_salon` | 5 |
| `gas` | 3 |
| `bus` | 1 |
| `post` | 1 |

## Classified, but the app has no PoiType for it

These are not free. Each needs a catalog entry, an icon and two
translations before a task can be tagged with it — the difference
that left `gas`, `post`, `clinic` and `bus` matching zero rows until
KAN-398.

## Landmarks, historic places and the culture cluster

Wanted for recommendations and for a feature still to be built, so measured
separately. The important finding is that **the bottleneck here is not the
import** — most of this material was never rejected in the first place.

### Already in `poi`, and unreachable

`poi_type` rows for the culture cluster today:

```
 3,773  church              1,100  art_gallery        251  amusement_park
 1,968  beach                 645  library            212  stadium
 1,865  historical_landmark   622  museum             128  tourist_attraction
 1,725  park                  406  movie_theater       49  botanical_garden
                              296  cultural_center     45  aquarium / 39 zoo
```

13,124 rows. Only `park` (1,725) and `library` (645) are types a user can
tag a task with. The rest are unreachable *as errands* — but that is not the
same as unreachable: `CLUSTER_LEISURE_TYPES` is a parallel list to `PoiType`,
and KAN-293 already consumes `museum`, `attraction`, `aquarium`,
`historical_landmark` and `tourist_attraction` through it. So this is not a
`PoiType` union question. It is the tourism grouping described below, and it
is blocked on a different thing entirely — the leisure path reads OSM, not
these rows.

That is also why the candidates table holds only 21 churches and 4 historic
sites: `church`, `historical_landmark`, `museum` and `art_gallery` were all in
the 111-id filter, so those rows were kept all along.

### What the candidates genuinely add

25,625 rows under `Landmarks and Outdoors`, `Arts and Entertainment` and
`Spiritual Center`, which split three ways:

| bucket | rows | |
|---|---:|---|
| Destination — somewhere a person goes | 12,090 | Scenic Lookout 1,355 · Plaza 1,038 · Garden 766 · Music Venue 531 · Monument 475 · Concert Hall 348 · Spiritual Center 348 · Bridge 321 · Harbor or Marina 291 · History Museum 285 · Theater 255 · Castle 134 · Lighthouse 122 · Palace 41 |
| Nature — a destination for a trip, not an errand | 1,598 | River 333 · Mountain 325 · Lake 271 · Surf Spot 226 · Waterfall 91 · Nature Preserve 80 · Hot Spring 75 |
| Geography — not a place you visit | 11,937 | Structure 2,974 · City 1,719 · Neighborhood 1,695 · Other Great Outdoors 1,651 · Farm 1,634 · Field 969 · Village 568 · Town 288 |

The "we want the Landmarks, but not the Outdoors" split does not fall on the
parent name: `park` and `beach` are both under Outdoors and both already ship,
while `Structure` and `Neighborhood` are the same parent and are pure
geography. It falls on the leaf, as everywhere else in this work.

The middle bucket is the genuinely open question. A waterfall or a scenic
lookout is not an errand and does not belong on the Today screen, but it is
exactly what a recommendations or trip feature would want. Whether those 1,598
rows are promoted depends on what that feature turns out to be — so they should
be held as `pending` rather than rejected, since rejecting is the one decision
the table makes hard to undo once it is dropped.

One caveat on the destination bucket: 1,930 of its 12,090 rows carry the bare
`Arts and Entertainment` parent with no leaf at all, so what they are is unknown
until someone reads the names. Same shape as the bare `Business and
Professional Services` problem, and the same method applies.

## Tourism: Nature and Landmarks — ticket-ready

Not part of KAN-404. Written down here because Jira was unreachable; these
should be filed and built on their own branches.

**Two kinds of tourism, both first-class.** The app needs to deal with
*Nature* (a walk in a park, a waterfall, a miradouro) and *Landmarks*
(historic and cultural places) as separate things, because they answer
different intents and feed different features. Neither is an errand, and
that distinction is the whole design constraint: a castle must never
compete with "buy bread" for the Nearby hero card.

### Consumers, current and planned

| feature | status | needs |
|---|---|---|
| "Central Park is right there" (KAN-293) companion on an errand cluster | ships | Nature + Landmarks near a cluster of stops |
| Local trip: "I'll walk around Baixa, I have 5 things to do, and I want to see historic places while I'm there" | planned | Landmarks within a walkable area, alongside the user's own tasks |
| Nature proximity: "you're near a park/waterfall — fancy a walk?" | planned | Nature near the user |

### Defect blocking all three: two leisure types can never fire

`CLUSTER_LEISURE_TYPES` (`src/types/index.ts:450`) is what KAN-293
iterates over. `refreshHabitatCacheIfStale` filters the prefetch through
`isOsmMappable` (`src/services/habitatCache.ts:759`), which admits a type
only if it is in `POI_OSM_TAGS` or `SUPPLEMENTARY_OSM_TAGS`:

```
park                 POI_OSM_TAGS            prefetched
museum               SUPPLEMENTARY_OSM_TAGS  prefetched
attraction           SUPPLEMENTARY_OSM_TAGS  prefetched
aquarium             SUPPLEMENTARY_OSM_TAGS  prefetched
historical_landmark  neither                 NEVER PREFETCHED
tourist_attraction   neither                 NEVER PREFETCHED
```

So the cache never holds them and `clusterLeisure` queries for rows nothing
writes. In Portugal that loses castles, monasteries and miradouros — the
exact draw the feature exists for, and the exact material the local-trip
feature will be built on. Same shape as KAN-398's dead
`gas`/`post`/`clinic`/`bus`.

**Why the tests pass.** `__tests__/services/clusterLeisure.test.ts:124`
seeds `historical_landmark` straight into a fake cache, proving detection
against data production cannot produce; and the prefetch test asserts the
*requested* set (`proximityHabitatPrefetch.test.ts:185`) rather than what
survives `isOsmMappable`. The regression test to add: every
`CLUSTER_LEISURE_TYPES` member must be mappable, so the lists cannot drift
again.

`historic=*` is the OSM vocabulary for the first. `tourist_attraction` may
simply be `attraction` under a second name — worth deciding, not assuming.

### The structural blocker: the feature cannot see what we import

`clusterLeisure` reads the habitat cache, populated from **OSM Overpass**
(`osm_fetched_at`, `isOsmMappable`), not from the Cloudflare `poi` table.
So the culture rows we already hold in D1 do not reach it, and **neither
would anything KAN-404 promotes**:

```
already in poi_type      3,773 church · 1,968 beach · 1,865 historical_landmark
                         1,725 park · 1,100 art_gallery · 622 museum
                           296 cultural_center · 128 tourist_attraction
                            49 botanical_garden · 45 aquarium · 39 zoo

waiting in poi_candidate  Landmarks  ~12,090 destinations (Scenic Lookout 1,355,
                                     Plaza 1,038, Garden 766, Monument 475,
                                     Bridge 321, History Museum 285, Castle 134,
                                     Lighthouse 122, Palace 41, Spiritual Center 348)
                          Nature      ~1,598 (River 333, Mountain 325, Lake 271,
                                     Surf Spot 226, Waterfall 91, Nature Preserve 80,
                                     Hot Spring 75, Island 55)
```

Promotion alone therefore surfaces nothing. Either the leisure path learns
to read the POI API — which makes everything we import available, offline
included, and is the only route that scales past what Overpass will serve
— or it stays OSM-only and the imported material is used by the trip
feature through a different path.

**That decision comes first.** Building the Nature and Landmarks grouping
before it is settled risks modelling the data for a consumer that cannot
read it.

### What the grouping needs to express

- Nature and Landmarks as two distinct groups, not one "leisure" bucket
- kept out of `PoiType`, so they can never surface as an errand or be tagged
  on a task — `CLUSTER_LEISURE_TYPES` is the existing precedent for a
  parallel list, and it works
- reachable by area for the trip case (what is walkable around Baixa), not
  only by proximity to a single point
- honest about source: OSM and Foursquare rows carry different licences and
  different ids, and the culture cluster will hold both
