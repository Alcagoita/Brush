# Brush — Session Context & Working Handbook
*Handoff file for new Claude sessions. Last updated: 2026-07-19. Owner: Olegário.*

## 1. What the app is

**Brush (Brush Away)** — a calm, location-aware to-do app (React Native 0.85 / Expo 56, TypeScript, Android-first, iOS later). Every task is tied to a real-world place *type* (pharmacy, café, supermarket… 16 built-in types + custom). When the user walks near a matching place, the app surfaces the task. Completion gesture = a painted **brush stroke** (Reanimated scaleX, never a checkbox). "Brush" is always a verb.

**The emotional contract:** no guilt, no urgency, no pressure. A task not done isn't overdue — it's waiting for the right moment. The app is a helper, not a reminder. "We don't care where you solve your task" — place *types*, not addresses.

**The moat:** works offline. GPS works without data; only place lookup needs the network — and the app caches its own map (OSM). No competitor does offline location to-dos.

## 2. Brand voice (non-negotiable)

- First-person companion ("I'll keep an eye out", "I know my way around"), peer not assistant. "How can I help?" was explicitly rejected as chatbot voice.
- Questions over labels: "What do you need?", "Where does this happen?", "Which part of your life?", "Going somewhere?".
- Banned words in UI: POI, cache, mode, snapshot, geofence, optimize, itinerary, overdue, missed, skipped, expired, deadline, edit, manage, archive, history, best, optimal, recommended.
- Memory framing: "I'll know Faro until July 24", "Forget this place" (delete = forgetting; but canceling a plan = "Not going anymore" — *forget* is reserved for past-trip memories).
- Sentence case, never ALL CAPS labels. No emoji as icons (AppIcon/PoiIcon components only). Accent is warm amber — **never green**. No drop shadows — 1px `line` borders carry elevation. Geist font, weights 400/500/600, tabular-nums on all changing numbers.
- The app never lies: no fake 100% days, no presence claims from date-only data, no unverifiable numbers (store counts), no distances presented as routed when they're straight-line.

## 3. Core doctrine (settled — cite these, don't relitigate)

1. **Reveal facts freely; order stops on request only; judge/command never.** Bundle cards state what *can* happen where; routes are built only when the user asks; "best way"/"you should" never appear.
2. **Pull vs push:** the app never says "go now", but when the user says it (Take me there, One trip), it already knows the way.
3. **Absence is default:** chips, cards, buttons render only when they have something true to show. No empty states, no disabled buttons, no placeholder apologies.
4. **Explicit beats inferred:** Home address (KAN-247), favorites (KAN-290) — the user tells the app; the app never guesses identity-level facts.
5. **Opt-in urgency:** the Time field = the user inviting a reminder. One calm notification, never re-fired on rollover, exempt from quiet hours (they asked).
6. **Fix forward, never claw back:** data-bug migrations never revoke awarded streaks/points/achievements (KAN-264).
7. **Foreground-only location — permanent** (KAN-231 closed as DECIDED): never request background/always-on location, never native background geofences. "While using the app" is the model.
8. **API minimalism:** Google is expensive and capped. Cache-first (OSM/SQLite) always; Google is discovery + gap-filler with hard per-computation budgets (see §6). OSM = cacheable source (ODbL); Google Places data must not be cached long-term (ToS) except place IDs / short-term snapshots.
9. **Surface ownership:** ContextChip owns presence (real location); Calendar owns plans (dates); "Where we've been" owns memories; Today owns now. Copy must never claim another surface's job.
10. **Monetization doctrine (revised 2026-07-19): "monetize fulfillment, never placement."** Two categories: (A) sponsored PLACEMENT (partner pays to appear) — contained to the trip's "While you're there" ONLY, labeled, area-fetched, core loop permanently ad-free; (B) monetized FULFILLMENT (affiliate link on an organically-shown action, e.g. "Get tickets" on the KAN-293 leisure line) — allowed wherever the suggestion is organic, with the inviolable line that no commercial relationship may ever influence detection, ranking, wording, or frequency. No prices/discounts/deal language anywhere, ever.

## 4. Architecture facts (verified in code)

- **Location:** expo-location, foreground `watchPositionAsync`, two-tier accuracy (coarse/fine, KAN-55), 3-min timer + 200 m movement gate (`src/services/proximity.ts`). `getPositionLowAccuracy` falls back to GPS offline. No native geofences in use.
- **Places online:** Google Places API (New) REST in `src/services/maps.ts` — searchNearby (batches multiple types in ONE call, 20-result cap per request), searchText, autocomplete, `openInMaps`/`openMapsSearch` deep-links. Trust `primaryType`, not `types[0]`.
- **Places offline:** habitat cache — SQLite (`src/services/habitatCache.ts`), OSM/Overpass source (`osmPlaces.ts`), all POI types prefetched (KAN-238), per-type cap 50, cross-source place identity (Google↔OSM merged). Trip downloads (`tripDownload.ts`: `computeTripExpiresAt`, `shouldPreRefreshTrip`, `refreshTripArea`, `TRIP_RADIUS_PRESETS`) — expiry/pre-refresh are pure derivations, no schedulers.
- **Data:** Firestore, offline persistence on, unlimited cache (`firebase.ts`). All user data under `/users/{uid}/`. Tasks: `date` mutates on rollover; `originDate` (immutable, KAN-264) is the calendar day; `completedPlaceId/Name` recorded at brush (KAN-226); `poiPlaceId` exists but NO UI sets it (KAN-265 = open decision: build pin UI or remove field).
- **Inference:** `poiInference.ts` (keyword dict EN+pt-PT, self-growing) + `poiLlm.ts` (on-device TFLite ~90 KB) — both offline; wired into import AND quick-add suggestion (suggested-POI chip state, KAN-249: nearTint dashed = app's guess; confirm/ignore/replace feed learn-back).
- **Learned places:** `learnedPlaces.ts` — N=3 brushes at same internal place id promotes it; "your usual".
- **Screens of note:** TodayScreen (post-KAN-260 cleanup: no pts in header, no %, brush-stroke-only done state, "N waiting"), CalendarScreen (trip entry row `tripForDate(selectedDate)`, day-driven single row; "Where we've been ›" secondary row), TripPlannerScreen (rendering-only over `useTripPlanner` step hook: destination→dates→radius→downloading), WhereWeveBeenScreen (year timeline), OffGridScreen, PlacesIKnowScreen (owns trip refresh/delete actions), TaskFormScreen (folder: index.tsx, PoiTile, poiSuggestions), MiniTimePicker (custom clock, quiet surface2 12h/24h pill toggle), ContextChip, NearbyCard, ItineraryOptionsScreen (KAN-281/282).
- **Testing:** Jest in `__tests__/` mirroring `src/`; offline paths = mocked NetInfo (KAN-227 pattern) — NO airplane-mode E2E, never build network-simulation infra. Detox exists (`e2e/auth`, `e2e/events`) but is minimal. Contrast test guards palette (KAN-258); ESLint guard rejects hardcoded colors outside theme/ (KAN-259).
- **Notifications:** notifee; TriggerType.TIMESTAMP pattern with deterministic ids (see EOD/STREAK/WEEKLY precedents in `notifications.ts`; task reminders = `task_time_{taskId}`); NO exact alarms (no SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM).

## 5. Feature map (shipped → in flight → future)

**Shipped:** offline core (habitat cache, cache-backed proximity, cross-source identity, all-types prefetch), offline expectations messaging (3 states), ContextChip (+ trip/mall states), Trip Planner "Going somewhere?" on Calendar (day-tap prefill, trip bands, stored-trip row states), dateless areas, "Where we've been" (past-trip timeline, "Forget this trip"), off-grid window ("Going off-grid?" in Profile nav + chip sheet; welcome-back toast N≥1 only), birthday tasks (IMPORT-ONLY, no POI, unscored, silent expiry), suggested-POI chip, Home address in Settings, calendar honesty (originDate + "brushed away on Wednesday" redemption copy), Today cleanup, dark palette retune + hardcoded-color sweep, mall snapshots (KAN-237), contextual trip suggestions (calendar signal + empty-state; far-pin signal DORMANT), coverage-failure invitation, time picker + calm reminder (KAN-280), "Take me there" (KAN-279 — shipped SIMPLER than spec: Maps text search, no resolver; header + row NavigateIcon, muted, only-when-far).
**In flight (Sprint 20):** KAN-281 "One trip for all of these" (options screen, "Stop by stop" card, destinationResolver.ts, ≤1 batched call + radius cap), KAN-282 mall card (see §6 — most-litigated ticket), KAN-283 cluster-box route handoff (shared `routeHandoff.ts` utils), KAN-251 trip-row copy (descoped to copy-only, day-driven).
**Backlog, scoped:** KAN-266 trip editing (edit mode via `{editTripId, initialStep}`), KAN-290 favorites (fold into Places I know; favorite = learned place with rank ∞), KAN-291 route refresh (session-scoped in-memory history — NO SQLite persistence; once-online-then-cache per screen session), KAN-293 leisure companion line ("Central Park is right there" + Keep it in mind).
**Future / gated:** KAN-239 Vacation Planner 2.0 ("While you're there" + partner monetization, post-release), KAN-234-related trip ideas, KAN-265 pin decision, Wear polish / widgets (featuring hooks), KAN-263 release screenshots → KAN-261/262 landing page (hero copy frozen; callouts = "Works offline" + "Going somewhere?"; site repo location was never confirmed — ask).

**Release plan** (docs/brush-release-plan.pdf): closed testing 12 testers/14 days → Portugal soft launch (pt-PT shipped; in-app review API only at payoff moments) → official launch ("The to-do app that waits for you"); featuring hooks: offline collections, Wear, widgets, honest Data Safety.

## 6. KAN-282 mall detection — final resolved design (hardest-won decisions)

- "Big mall (100+ stores)" was a **proxy**; the real metric is coverage of THIS user's tasks. No API can count mall stores — never try (no per-mall detail calls, no Overpass counts — deleted).
- **Three radii:** `ROUTE_MAX_RADIUS_M` 5 km = how far the user will go (only search range); `MALL_CONTAINMENT_RADIUS_M` 250 m = is the store inside the building (pin→store evidence, checked against ALL cached places, not resolved stops); `MALL_VERIFY_USER_RADIUS_M` 1 km = near enough to justify verification.
- **Evidence tiers:** snapshot (incl. auto mini-snapshots) → cached OSM places → near-mall verification (ONE pin-centered 250 m Nearby Search, persisted as auto mini-snapshot, once per mall per lifetime) → otherwise NO CARD (opportunistic, never hunted; self-heals via OSM refresh + visit snapshot offer).
- **Hard budget: ≤2 Google calls per trip computation** (the KAN-281 batched call + at most one verification), spy-tested.
- Qualify = venue covers ≥2 tasks; rank = coverage desc, then user-distance; covered tasks re-resolve to the mall's own places for handoff; card = "All in one place", nearTint/nearBorder, BELOW "Stop by stop".

## 7. Working process with Claude Code (learned the hard way)

- **Tickets must be self-contained descriptions. Claude Code does not read comments.** Fold every decision into the description body ("supersedes all comments" header pattern).
- **Jira MCP bug:** markdown descriptions sometimes save with literal `\n` mangling — after every create/edit, CHECK the returned description; if mangled, re-edit with proper newlines.
- **Verify code before speccing.** Multiple tickets referenced things that didn't exist (the "trip sheet", the KAN-279 resolver, native picker). Grep first; cite files/lines in tickets.
- **Ship-vs-spec drift is normal and often good** (KAN-279 text search, single route card, custom time picker) — accept deviations explicitly in the ticket with date + "decided with Olegário", update ACs, never let QA flag agreed changes.
- **ACs must be mechanically enforceable:** call-budget spies, "component untouched" assertions, fixtures for every branch incl. the absent/null path.
- **One ticket per branch; changes to Done work = NEW ticket** (never reopen/amend shipped tickets' scope). Decision tickets get "DECISION/DECIDED:" titles and close as records.
- **Gitflow:** features from develop → PR to develop; ticket transitions: start = In Development, PR open = Testing, merged = Done. Sprint end checklist lives in CLAUDE.md (never skip the GitHub release). Never merge without Olegário's explicit consent.
- **Jira access:** cloudId `035e98f2-9261-4cb8-a008-64f565594dea`, project KAN, site olegarioncnascimento.atlassian.net. Issue types: Epic/Story/Task/Bug/Subtask. Transitions: 11 To Do, 21 In Development, 31 Testing, 41 Done.
- Olegário's style: brainstorms in rough ideas → wants brand/UX pushback (uses "Branding Expert" / "Senior UI/UX designer" personas), then tickets. Prefers concise. Portuguese market first (EN + pt-PT copy always). When he vetoes (e.g. Calendar tab, persistent history), the veto usually enforces the app's own rules — check ideas against §3 before proposing.

## 8. Standing copy inventory (approved strings)

"What do you need?" (sheet/header) · rotating example placeholders · "Where does this happen?" · "Which part of your life?" · "Around when?" / "Anytime is fine" · "Add it" · "Just the what and the where" · "Got it — I'll keep an eye out." · "N waiting" (never "left"/"overdue") · "Going somewhere?" / "Off to Faro soon" / "Faro · until July 24" / "Going somewhere else?" / "Not going anymore" · "Where we've been" / "Forget this trip" · "Going off-grid?" / "Got it — I'll know this area until 18:00." / "Welcome back — N things brushed away while you were off-grid." · "You're outside the area I know by heart…" (+ invitation variant) · "Take me there" · "One trip for all of these" / "Stop by stop" / "All in one place" / "About X km all together" · "8 of these can happen at Colombo — one stop." · "{name} · your usual" · "You wanted this at 14:00 — {task}" · "It's a birthday" toggle blurb · Home note: "So I know my way around your neighborhood. This stays on your device." · "{Park} is right there — fancy a walk while you're at it?" / "Keep it in mind".

## 9. Open questions (ask Olegário, don't decide)

- KAN-265: pin-a-place UI — build or delete `poiPlaceId`?
- onAccent white-on-amber ~2.5:1 contrast (both modes) — deliberate design decision pending.
- Calendar discoverability (big-number tap) — tab bar VETOED; moment-based first-complete-day hint proposed but he's "not sold"; unresolved.
- Landing page repo location — never confirmed.
- KAN-290/291 rewrites approved in discussion but descriptions may still need the agreed changes baked in (Places-I-know placement; session-scoped history).
