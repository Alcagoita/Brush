/**
 * lantern.ts — KAN-301 Lantern state resolver + home hysteresis.
 *
 * Pure decision logic for the Today header "Lantern": given the current place
 * context (mall/trip, already prioritized by proximity.ts's
 * findActivePlaceContext), the distance to the stored home, connectivity and a
 * reverse-geocoded city name, it decides the single state to render.
 *
 * Kept independent of geolocation/Firestore/theme so the mall > trip >
 * home/outside priority, the unset (no-home) branch and the home-boundary
 * hysteresis are all unit-testable without mocking any of them — mirroring
 * contextChip.ts, whose priority order this deliberately reuses.
 *
 * The resolver returns a copy-free discriminated union (raw names, not
 * localized strings); the Lantern component maps each kind to its icon, halo
 * token and localized label.
