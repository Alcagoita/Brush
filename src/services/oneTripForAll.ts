/**
 * oneTripForAll.ts — KAN-281 "One trip for all of these".
 *
 * Orchestrates destinationResolver.ts across a whole trip, then orders the
 * resolved stops. Two hard rules (decided 2026-07-16):
 *
 *   - The entire trip computation makes AT MOST ONE Places API call: every
 *     task is first resolved locally (pinned/learned/cache — no network),
 *     and whatever POI types are still unresolved after that get bundled
 *     into a single `searchNearbyPlaces` call (never one call per task,
 *     never iterative widening).
 *   - We never compute routes — Google does. Ordering here is a trivial
 *     client-side greedy nearest-neighbor pass over straight-line distance,
 *     purely to pick a sensible stop sequence before handing off.
 *
 * KAN-282 note (2026-07-19): mall discovery for the "All in one place" card
 * is NOT done here and adds no call of its own. After a long detour that
 * tried piggybacking `shopping_mall` onto (or beside) this Google call, mall
 * detection moved entirely onto OSM data — the offline habitat cache, which
 * proximity's background refresh and trip-area downloads already populate
 * with `shop=mall` way/relation footprints (including their area, for the
 * big-vs-small filter). Google's Nearby Search was both a noise source
 * (individual stores mistagged `shopping_mall`, with no geometry to tell a
 * real mall's footprint from a point) and a 20-result-cap liability, so it
 * no longer participates in mall discovery at all. See mallRoute.ts.
