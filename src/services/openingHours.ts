/**
 * openingHours.ts — KAN-318: is a place open right now?
 *
 * The backend bakes a default open/close window per POI into `open_min` /
 * `close_min` (minutes from local midnight) — keyed on the source's category
 * (Overture since KAN-438; cloudflare/extraction/opening_hours.py), with OSM
 * `opening_hours` as a later refinement. The app does only this
 * trivial check and hides closed places from the Nearby suggestion.
 *
 * A missing window means "always open" — which also stands in for 24h and for
 * "unknown". We never hide a place on absence of data (the app never lies /
 * never hides on a guess). Windows are same-day (open < close), local time.
