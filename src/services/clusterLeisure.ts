/**
 * clusterLeisure.ts — KAN-293 ("Central Park is right there").
 *
 * When a notable leisure or cultural place happens to sit among the stops of
 * an errand cluster, the cluster box mentions it once. The errand run becomes
 * an excuse for a walk. The place is never persisted as a task; if the user
 * accepts it, the card adds it to that one Maps handoff only.
 *
 * Detection is pure and cache-only. It reads rows the habitat cache already
 * holds — the leisure types ride along in the SAME Overpass request the
 * proximity engine already makes for the user's own POI types (see
 * CLUSTER_LEISURE_TYPES and proximity.ts's prefetchTypes), so this feature
 * issues no request of its own and costs no Google call whatsoever.
 *
 * COMMERCIAL NEUTRALITY (KAN-293 doctrine — monetize fulfilment, never
 * placement): nothing in this module takes a partner, sponsor, bid or
 * revenue input. The only signals are physical: is the place one of a fixed
 * hand-authored set of types, does it have a real name, does its cached OSM
 * footprint suggest a real destination, and how far is it from a stop the user
 * was already going to. Nobody can pay to appear here, and no ordering below
 * may ever be influenced by a commercial relationship. The ticket link this
 * surfaces (`website`) is the place's own OSM-tagged
 * site — if that link ever becomes monetized, the change belongs to the
 * fulfilment action in KAN-239, never to the detection in this file.

 *  - a candidate must be within LEISURE_NEAR_STOP_RADIUS_M of at least ONE
 *    cluster stop (any stop, not just the anchor — the walk passes them all)
 *  - it must have a real name; an unnamed row ("Park") says nothing worth
 *    interrupting for, and the copy is built around naming the place
 *  - it must not already BE one of the cluster's stops (a park the user has
 *    an errand at is not a discovery)
 *  - larger cached OSM footprints outrank tiny fixtures; distance to the
 *    nearest stop breaks ties inside each footprint tier
 *  - if every candidate lacks footprint info, nearest-first is preserved
 *  - exactly one suggestion per bundle, ever
 *
 * Never throws — any failure yields null, and the line is simply absent.
