 * Shared rule engine backing three signals (calendar, far-pin, empty-state
 * rotation — the last needs no engine, it's already a rotating nudge slot).
 * A signal instance is offered at most once, ever — dismissal is permanent,
 * unlike errandBundles.ts's per-day table. Own tiny SQLite table (same
 * expo-sqlite dependency habitatCache.ts/errandBundles.ts already use), so
 * "don't show this again" survives an app restart with no new dependency.
 *
 * Signal id format is the caller's contract, not enforced here — e.g.
 * `calendar:{eventId}` or `farpin:{taskId}` — as long as it's stable for the
 * same underlying event/task and distinct for a new one (a rescheduled trip
 * or a new task is a new instance, per the ticket's "new trips/events are
 * new instances" rule).
