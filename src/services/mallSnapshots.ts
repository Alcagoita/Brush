/**
 * mallSnapshots.ts — the current mall snapshot (KAN-237).
 *
 * Manual, toggle-driven equivalent of Trip Planner (KAN-234) for a single
 * shopping mall: user flips a Profile toggle while physically inside a
 * mall, we look it up via a Places nearby-search, download its POIs once
 * (reusing tripDownload.ts's downloadAreaSnapshot — same atomic
 * delete+reinsert cache write), and persist a singleton Firestore doc so
 * proximity.ts can skip the live API entirely while inside its bounds.
 *
 * Singleton (not a collection like Trip): only one mall is ever "learned"
 * at a time, so cacheAreaId is a fixed constant rather than per-place —
 * re-toggling reuses the same tagged rows instead of piling up old areas.
