/**
 * useLearnedPlaces — KAN-230
 *
 * Fetches the user's full brush-at-a-known-place history once per uid and
 * computes the on-device learned-place ranking (learnedPlaces.ts). One-shot
 * fetch, not a listener (repo rule: no persistent onSnapshot for this kind
 * of derived, infrequently-changing state) — call `refresh()` after a task
 * completes with a known place so the ranking picks up the new brush.
 *
 * A monotonic request token guards against two races:
 *   - overlapping refresh() calls resolving out of order (an older response
 *     arriving after a newer one would otherwise overwrite fresher state)
 *   - a uid change while a fetch for the *previous* uid is still in flight —
 *     that response is discarded, and the ranking is cleared synchronously
 *     on the uid change itself so a shared device never shows one account's
 *     learned places while the next account's fetch is still pending.
